# Analyzing the State of the NFL's Kickoff Returns
In this project, I analyze NFL kickoff data from the 2005-06 to 2023-24 seasons and determine if a rule change should be implemented. The data was retrieved from the [Official NFL Stats Website](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/).

## Programs Used
+ **SQL:** Used to collect, clean, join, and transform the data. <be>
+ **R Studio:** Used to create the data visualizations of the results.

## Data Definitions
  + **Avg Yards per Return (Avg):** Average number of yards gained on a team's kickoff return.<br>
  + **Total Kick Returns (Ret):** Total number of kickoffs returned (does not include touchbacks or kicks out-of-bounds).<br>
