We found a significant relationship between the year and average kick return yards (p < 0.001, `R^2` = 0.8693), with a 58.77-yard decrease in average kick return yards for every 1 year increase. `Avg_KRet_Yds_Per_Season = 119366.35 - 58.77*(Year)`

<h2 style="color:#CDB38B;">Insights & Recommendations</h2>

Several key data points emerge upon analyzing the percentage changes within the dataset. Notably, the years 2011 and 2023 stand out as exhibiting the most significant increases/decreases.

In 2011, there was a notable decline in the average number of kick return yards by approximately 400 yards compared to the previous year, representing a 28% decrease. Moreover, the total number of 20+ yard returns decreased by around 250 (a 21% decline), while the total number of 40+ yard returns dropped by 42 (a 36.8% decrease). The number of touchbacks surged dramatically from 416 to 1120 in this season, marking a substantial 169% increase due to the relocation of the kickoff to the 35-yard line. Additionally, 2011 witnessed the first instance where the average number of returns per team fell below 60, declining from 64 in 2010 to 43 (a 32.8% decrease).

In the most recent season (2023-24), there were significantly more fair catches than the cumulative total of the preceding 18 seasons. The league experienced a reduction of 300 kickoff return yards in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting a 41.4% decrease. Touchbacks saw an increase of approximately 360 (a 22% rise). Notably, the number of 20+ and 40+ yard returns experienced substantial declines in 2023, decreasing by 37.5% and 53.9%, respectively. Furthermore, this season marked the first instance where the average number of kick returns dropped below 20.

According to the NFL, the implemented rule changes have significantly reduced injuries during kickoffs. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between permitting kickoffs while mitigating potential injuries. One proposed solution involves revising the kickoff setup. Additionally, it is recommended that a touchback or fair catch results in the ball being placed at the 20-yard line instead of the current 25-yard line. Presently, there is minimal incentive to field a kickoff given that the average kickoff yardage remains around 22-23 yards. Opting for a fair catch or touchback automatically grants the receiving team an additional 2-3 yards. The league could consider adopting strategies akin to those seen in the XFL or UFL to encourage more kickoffs while reducing injury risks. Failure to address these concerns may lead to the potential extinction of one of the NFL's most dynamic and thrilling plays within the next 5 years.
